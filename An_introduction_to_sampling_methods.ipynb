You&#8217;ll find <strong><a href=\"https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/statistics-definitions/simple-random-sample/\">simple random sampling</a></strong> in a school lottery, where individual names are picked out of a hat.

        "<p><strong><span style=\"color: blue;\">Step 2:</span></strong> Find out if the study picked groups of participants.
